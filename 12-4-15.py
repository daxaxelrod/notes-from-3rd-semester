quick thing on zeroth law of thermodynamics
 validates idea of tempertature

 2 objects in thermal equalirium with a 3rd object are equal to eachother

Chapter 19
    Kinetic Theory of gasses
    def review():
        look over the first two setions of chater 19

    pressure volume equals N R tempertature
    if you hold pressure constant
        volme is proportional to tempertature
    pressure Volume is proportional to the tempertature of the system

    PV = N*R*T
        n = number of moles in the system
        r = gas constant has a value of 8.31 joules per mole kelvin (j/ mol*K)

    Pv = N * k * T
        n is the same
        k is the boltzmann constant == 1.38 times 10 ^ -23 j/k

    make sure you are always working with kelvin
        add 273 to the celius value

Ideal Gasses and work

    Isothermal process (constant temperature) work:
        pv =nrt where pressure = nrt/V

        work is the integral from Vi to Vf of pressure d volume
            plug in pressure from above
            bam
                we are left integrating 1/V

                work then equals
                n * R * T (ln V) from vi to vf
                Word done for isothermic = nrt ln(Vf/Vi)

    remember in constant volume
        work is 0

    isobaric work equal pressure(vf-vi)

    Constant temperature process
        we get a curve were pressume is proportional to 1 / V


Specific heat

recall
    Q = cm detla temperature   c is specific heat, m is mass

    can also write in moles but pay attention to units bro


for constant volume case

Q = c n delta t c equals 12.5 moles kelvin
delta E = Q minus work


    for constant volume case
        the way to account for internal energy change isisssssss is
            delta e = Molar specific heat *moles * delta temperature

            path independant
    this can be used for change in internal energy
    all processes with same delta t have the same #!/usr/bin/env python

    for constant pressuure case:
        Q = molar specific heat at constant pressure * n * delta t
            where molar blah blah is 20.8 j / mol k

        at constant pressure, work = p delta v
        can also write n * R * delta t
            any change has to come from the temperature

        Recall first law
            delta e is molar thing *n * delta t
            constant specific heat for volume * n delta t
                ===
            constant specific heat for pressure

            Cp - Cv = R

adiabatic means that there is no heat exchange
bc internal enrgy is path independant (thing potential with grav)
    use delta E = cv *n * delta t
