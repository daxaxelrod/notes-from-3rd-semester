do we need to know conversion factors for pressure
find all the constants you can and put them on the index cards
should have numbers that relate to ideal gasses

what is a heat engine
    something that can convert heat to work
    there is always a working substance (steam, gas)
    undergoes a cyclic process


General representation of a heat engine
    need a high temperature reservior
    also need a low tenperature reservoir
    Heat Qh is absorbed from hot reservoir during each cyclic
        some heat is converted to work
        some small ammount of energy gets lost and gets transfered to low temp reservoir

    to explicitly keep track of heat flow directions
    heat flow to engine +|Qh|
    heat flow out of the engire -|QL|

    WORK EQUALS |Qh| - |QL|

Heat enginre efficiency
    defined by work outut divided by heat input
    Epsilon = Work/ Qh
    Epsilon = (1 -| Ql /Qh|)


EXAMPLE
    Carnot Engine (the best engine evvvvvaaa)
        GOOGLE THIS BITCH
    from a to b first is isothermal expansion
    heat Qh is absorbed fronm the reservoir

    from b to c adiabatic expansion (doesnt undergo heat exchange)
        temperature drops to Tl

    from c to d isothermal compression at Tl
        during compression heat Ql is lost

    from d to a adiabatic compression ( Q = 0 )
        temperature increases to Temp high

    for the work done during carnot cycle
        for full cycle delta e is 0 # which means Q is equal to W
            Change in entropy for full cycle is also 0
        if q equals w q equals Qh + 0 + Ql + 0

        so work equals qh minus ql

    for the entropy during carnot
        during isothermal processes
        change in entropy is just heat over temp
        Entropy high = Qh / Temp H
        Entropy low = -|QL| / Temp L

        For adiabatic processes, no heat exchange so no entropy change

        so for thee full cycke the entropy change is Q H/ temp H = Ql over Temp L

        Temp L/ Temp H = Q l / Q h

        so Epislon, specific for carnot cycle is 1 - Temp low/ temp high

        HW problem
        work done is area of box

for the index cards
    for Constant pressure process
        Q = N*Cv* delta T
        for monatomic ideal gaas
            Cv is 3/2 R
    for Constant pressure
        cp is 5/2 R
        Q = N*Cp* delta T

for noncarnot cycle
    epsilon = Work / Qh
