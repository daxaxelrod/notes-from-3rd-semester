final day of class

Real engines

combustion engine (Otto cycle)

expansion - gas air mix drawn into cylender

piston compresses mixture

blah blah

heres how refridgeration works
    heat engine running backards
    uses the heat resevoir as a dump

problem with perpetual motion machines
    friction dissapates energy
    violates the 2nd law of thermosynamics
    extracting heat from a substance takes work



REVEIWIWIWIWIWIWI

review of fluids
    Fluids
    hydrostatic pressuse weight of water that sits on top
    pressure = p not * desity of water * height of the water * gravity

    Pascales principle
        an applied pressure is felt equally throughout a closed containter. how hydrolic lifts work
    archemedies principle
        buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced
            how much of thr object is submerged? whats the weight of tge liquid for that volume

    Bernoillis equaltion
        TODO look up in textbook
        can simplify quite a bit with cancelling

thermodynamics
    linear expansion = change in length = original length * expansion coefficiant (alpha) * delta temp
    volume expansion = change in volume = original volume * beta (?!?!?!?!) * change in temp

    specific heat
        main idea is that its a proportionallity between how much heat exchange occurs when there is a temperatur change in a system
        Q = c * mass * delta t
        or
        Q = c * moles * delta t
        c is in joules / mol * kelvin

        again what connect temp change and heat exchange

        solve problems of different substances at different temps
            they reach thermal equilibrium
            Q1 + Q2 + Q3 ...... = 0
            no net gain or loss of energy for system

        during phase transition, not temp change
            Q = L * mass
            L = heat of transformation



    WORK
        area under pressure volume curve
        work = intergral from volume initial to final of pressure * d volume
        constant volume work = 0
        constant pressure = p(vf - vi)
        isothermal process work = nrt LN (Vf/ Vi) # for idea gas

    First law of thermodynamics
        internal energy
        work is path dependent quantity
        heat is path dependent
        internal energy is not

        delta e = Q - Work

        for ideal gas
            delta E = Cv * N * delta temp
            can be used for all types of ideal gas things

        for ideal gas again
            if you dont know temp
            pv = nrt
            WRITE R ON INDEX CARD

            Adiabatic means Q = 0
            pv i gamma = pv gamma final so gamma equals Cp / Cv

        Entropy
            not going to be tested extensivly
            entropy has to increase when there is an irreversable
            entropy stays the same for reversable process

            second law of thermo

            CHANGE IN entropy = intergral from i to f of delta Q / Temp

            for adiabatic, delta entropy = 0
            for isothermal, Q/temp
            for constant volume delta s = n Cv ln (Temp final/ Temp initial)

            engines
                carbot cycle
                be able to calculate efficiancy for engine

    Important theme of the course
        MAIN SHIT
        PAY THE FUCK ATTENTION TO THIS

        decomposing vectors into components
            forces, momentum

        nmotion in 3d
            projectile motion
            forces and using force diagrams
                anytime the problem has forces, drag a diagrams
            mechanical energy and work
                be able to calculate for when enrgy is conserved and not conserved
                somtimes better to use energy rather than a force approach
                also when objects change height
            momentum
                collisions (know different types of collisions)
                consider momentum conservation in xyz directions
            rotation
            torque
            angular momentum
                be comforable with these
                calculate sum of tourques
                be able to connect translational momentum to rotaional
            gravitation
                be able to calculate force between 2 objects
                be able to use spherical shell therum

            and finally oscillations
                a cos(x) type stuff
                make sure to know equation for damped oscillations

            questions can be from all over the coure so no help there
