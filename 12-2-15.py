d Work = F dx
F = pressure * area of piston

d Work = pressure * area *dx
d Work = pressure * d Volume
# integrate both sides
from vi to vf
Work = the integral from ^^ of pressure * d Volume
    Work is given by area under the  PV curve
    if you are trying to compress the gas, going to have to do some Work

        examples
        cyclic prosses

        volume change is required for work to have been done

    special case
        constant volume = 0
        ISOBARIC (CONSTANT PRESSURE) process
        on our pv plot, its a horizontal line so its just the area of the rectanlge

        Well what about heat??
        we saw that work depends on thermodynamic path
        experiments show that heat minus work does not depend on thermosynamic path

    define change in internal energy as
        delta E = Q (heat that comes in) - Work (done by system)
        ^^system can store energy, kind of like potential energy

        def FIRST LAW OF thermosynamics():
            internal energy increase when heat is supplued to the system and decreases when work is down
            by the system

Work and heat are path dependent
    but internal energy is path independent

    work done by systenm (gas pushing on piston)
    internal energy is store by molecules


    first law() practice
        1 constant volume process
            no possibility of doing work,
            energy is translated into internal energy, no work is being done

        2 cyclic process
            from a to b but then back from b to a
                because interal energy is path independent,
                no change in interal energy
                sum of the internl energy = 0

                when you calculate gravitational potential, its path independent
                as long as you come back to the same hieght
                Q = Work
                important for understanding how engines work

        3 adiabatic process (Adiabatic means no exchange of heat with surroundings, Q = 0)
            this is fucking interestin
            wy am i so tired?
            fucking
            fuck
            anyway back to physics
                system is thermally insulated
                or process occurs to rapidly for appreciable heat exchange
            ADIABATIC = Q = 0
            delta internal energy == - Work

            WHen is piston is going down, leads to the increase in internal energy,
                this leads to ignition
                pretty cool

            4 Free expansion
                """ no exchange of heat with surroundings and no work done"""
                delta internal == 0
