hello again

kinectic theory of gasses
microscopic perspective

ideal gas means
    no internal structure
    each molicule is jsut a point mass/ particle
    carries translational kinetic energy
    no iteractions ubless participating in purly kinetic energy
    volume of molicule is negligible

    these are good for low density conditions

    pressure
        gas molicules are costantly exerting force on the container
        chapter 19.3
        pressure = nMvrms^2
                   _____
                    3V
        n is number of moles
        M is molecular mass
        V is volume
        vrms is square root of average value of the speed squared


        you can solve for rms speed

        for ideal gas in microscopic view of temperature
        vrms = root(3rt/M)

        higher temp means higher speed
        heavier gas molicule leads to lower speed

        mean free path how far to get gas to disperse

        around sea level, molicule will move 100nm before changing direction


        can also write in terms of mass and boltzmans constant

        Average Kinetic energy = 3/2 k temperature,
        where k is the boltzmans constant

        Energy interal = 3/2 NkT = 3/2 n R T


        just add delta e to everything to mainipulate in terms of Q - W

        FOR CONSTANT VOLUME, WORK IS 0

        _______________________________

        for constan volume process
        specific heat at constant volume = 3/2 times ideal gas constant (r)

        -------------------------------
        for constant pressure process
        cp - cv  = r

        plus in stuff on line 55

        we get Cp = 5/2 R

        each degree of freedom in rotation contributes about 1/2 KT to average kinetic energy

        for linear translation  k avg = 1/2 mv^2  = 3/2 kT

        for each direction, 1/2 kt
